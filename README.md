# Autonomous-Robot-Navigation-System
Build an autonomous robot capable of navigating through indoor environments using sensors and real-time processing. Implement obstacle detection and avoidance algorithms using ultrasonic sensors, infrared sensors, or LiDAR. Develop control algorithms for motor control and path planning to enable the robot to move autonomously.

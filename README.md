The Autonomous Robot Navigation System project aims to develop a robot capable of navigating and exploring its environment autonomously. Using a combination of sensors, actuators, and decision-making algorithms, the robot will be able to perceive its surroundings, plan optimal paths, and navigate obstacles to reach predefined goals.

# Key Features:

# Sensor Fusion and Perception:
Utilize various sensors, such as ultrasonic sensors, infrared sensors, LiDAR, and cameras, to perceive the robot's surroundings.
Implement sensor fusion techniques to integrate data from multiple sensors and generate accurate environment maps.

# Localization and Mapping (SLAM):
Implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms to create and update a map of the robot's environment in real-time.
Use odometry data, inertial sensors, and visual odometry to estimate the robot's pose relative to its surroundings.

# Path Planning and Navigation:
Develop path planning algorithms to generate optimal trajectories for the robot to navigate from its current location to predefined goals.
Consider factors such as obstacle avoidance, dynamic obstacles, and environmental constraints when planning paths.

# Obstacle Detection and Avoidance:
Implement algorithms for real-time obstacle detection and avoidance to ensure safe navigation in dynamic environments.
Utilize sensor data and environmental maps to detect obstacles and plan alternative paths to avoid collisions.

# Decision-Making and Control:
Develop decision-making algorithms to evaluate multiple navigation options and select the most suitable actions based on predefined objectives and constraints.
Implement low-level control algorithms to drive the robot's actuators (e.g., motors, servos) and execute planned trajectories with precision.
